# Relayer SDK

**Welcome to the LuxFHE Relayer SDK Docs.**

This section provides an overview of the key features of LuxFHE's Relayer JavaScript SDK.
The SDK lets you interact with FHE smart contracts without dealing directly with the Gateway Chain.

With the Relayer, FHE clients only need a wallet on the LuxFHE host chain. All interactions with the Gateway chain are handled through HTTP calls to the Relayer, which pays for it on the Gateway chain.

## Where to go next

If you're new to LuxFHE, start with the [Documentation](https://docs.lux.network/fhe) to understand the foundations.

Otherwise:

- Go to [**Setup guide**](initialization.md) to learn how to configure the Relayer SDK for your project.

- Go to [**Input registration**](input.md) to see how to register new encrypted inputs for your smart contracts.

- Go to [**User decryption**](user-decryption.md) to enable users to decrypt data with their own keys, once permissions have been granted via Access Control List(ACL).

- Go to [**Public decryption**](public-decryption.md) to learn how to decrypt outputs that are publicly accessible via HTTP.

- Go to [**Solidity ACL Guide**](https://docs.lux.network/fhe/acl) for more detailed instructions about access control.
